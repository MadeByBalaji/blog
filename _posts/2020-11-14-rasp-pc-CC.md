_Overview_

During this COVID-19 times all the schools and colleges are held online, where each student needs a High End PC at the same time with low cost and good features.


Although it has most of the features, it lacks few basic like Audio Jack, Speaker and the cost is little high when I can buy a SmartPhone or Second Hand PC's around ₹6,000 to ₹8,000 of price range. This Raspberry Pi-400 costs around ₹9,000 in robu.in


I'm done here!, See you soon..

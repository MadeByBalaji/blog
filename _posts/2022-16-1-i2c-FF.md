# I2C Protocol – Inter-Integrated Circuit

I2C stands for Inter Integrated Circuit, and is one of the most important communication protocols. It was developed by Philips Semiconductor, which is now known as NXP Semiconductors. Let's get to know how it works.

---

## Overview

- **Full form**: Inter-Integrated Circuit  
- **Type**: Bidirectional, serial protocol  
- **Nature**: Synchronous communication (due to the clock line)  
- **Wires**: 2-wire protocol  
  - **SCL** – Serial Clock Line  
  - **SDA** – Serial Data Line  
- **Addressing**: Supports 7-bit and 10-bit addressing  
- **Configuration**: Master-slave (can support multiple masters and multiple slaves)  
  - Number of devices are limited by bus capacitance  
- **Example**:  
  - Master: Controller  
  - Slave: Memory  

### Speed Modes

- Standard mode: ≤ 100 Kbit/s  
- Fast mode: ≤ 400 Kbit/s  
- Fast mode plus: ≤ 1 Mbit/s  
- High speed: ≤ 3.4 Mbit/s  
- Ultra-fast mode: ≤ 5 Mbit/s

## Open-Drain Configuration

The output stage of the devices connected to the I2C bus must have an *open-drain* configuration.

An open drain (or open collector) is the setup where:

- An nMOS transistor has its:
  - Source connected to ground
  - Base connected to the input
  - Drain left open

This leads to two conditions:

- **When transistor is active** → The value at drain ('D') is 0 (pulled down)  
- **When transistor is inactive** → The value is floating  

This configuration is used with a **pull-up resistor**, so that the line defaults to HIGH when idle, and can be pulled LOW to indicate activity.

Hence, in the I2C bus, SDA can be pulled LOW from its HIGH (default) state to indicate the start of a transaction.

---

## How the Transfer Works?

### Step 1: Start and Stop Conditions

- **Start Condition**:  
  - SDA: `1 → 0` while SCL is `1` → Start the transaction  
- **Stop Condition**:  
  - SDA: `0 → 1` while SCL is `1` → Stop the transaction  

**Note**:  
Data on SDA should never change when SCL is `1`, *except during start or stop* conditions.

> A master can only occupy the bus if it is IDLE. If the bus is BUSY, it must wait until it's free.

---

### Step 2: Data Transfer

- After the start condition, 1-bit transfer occurs per clock cycle  
- Data transfer format: **Byte-wise** (1 byte = 8 bits)  
- Each byte is followed by an **ACK/NACK** bit  
- Number of bytes is **unrestricted**

#### Clock Stretching

If the target (slave) is not ready to send/receive, it holds SCL LOW (pauses the clock).  
The data transfer resumes once SCL is released.

---

## Address Transfer

- Every device on the I2C bus has a unique address  
- After START, the master sends the address + R/W bit  
- Target device sends **ACK** if address matches

---

## Data Transfer

### WRITE (R/W bit = 0)

- Master sends bytes of data  
- Receiver/slave sends ACK after each byte  

### READ (R/W bit = 1)

- Slave takes control of the bus and sends data to master  
- Master sends ACK after each byte  

---

### Step 3: Stop Condition

- **SDA is pulled HIGH while SCL is HIGH** → Indicates STOP  
- The bus is released and becomes IDLE again

---

## Additional Important Points

### ACK/NACK Bit

- After each byte, the **receiver** pulls SDA LOW during the 9th clock cycle → ACK  
- If SDA remains HIGH during this clock pulse → NACK (no acknowledgement)  
  - Master then stops or re-initiates the transfer

---

### Bus Arbitration

If multiple masters try to access the bus simultaneously:

- Arbitration is done bit-by-bit  
- The **master that sends a '0' while others send '1'** wins

#### Example:

- Transfer seen from MSB first  
- Master 3 sends '1' while others send '0' → Master 3 loses  
- Master 1 later sends '1' while Master 2 sends '0' → Master 1 loses  
- **Master 2 wins**

---

## Addressing Modes

### 7-Bit Addressing

- Address byte = 7-bit address + 1-bit R/W flag = **8 bits**

### 10-Bit Addressing

- After START, **2 bytes** are sent:

1. **First Byte**: `11110XX(R/W)`  
   - Devices matching this pattern ACK  
   - All matched devices read the **second byte**

2. **Second Byte**: `XXXXXXXX`  
   - Target device acknowledges again

> If **First Byte** is `11111XX(R/W)` → Reserved for future I2C enhancements

## Cons of I2C

- Frame overhead due to ACK/NACK and addressing → Slower effective data rate  
- Half-duplex communication  
- Increased hardware complexity with multiple masters/slaves

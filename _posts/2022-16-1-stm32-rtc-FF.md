## Components:
1. STM32F446RE as controller [link](https://www.amazon.in/NUCLEO-F446RE-STM32F446RET6-development-integrates-XYG-Study/dp/B014IXUB1M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FAQAJN6X1FWI&dchild=1&keywords=stm32f446re&qid=1604331292&sprefix=stm32f446%2Caps%2C707&sr=8-1)

1. DS1307 RTC [link](https://www.amazon.in/Generic-ST-CO0362-DS1307-IC-Real-Clock-RTC/dp/B08P5CPPHJ/ref=sr_1_40?dchild=1&keywords=DS1307&qid=1610779605&sr=8-40&tag=duc21-21)

1. Jumper wires [link](https://www.amazon.in/ApTechDeals-Jumper-Female-breadboard-jumper/dp/B074J9CPV3/ref=sr_1_2_mod_primary_lightning_deal?crid=25YR2Z8ZGWY72&dchild=1&keywords=jumper+wires+for+arduino&qid=1604324158&sbo=Tc8eqSFhUl4VwMzbE4fw%2Fw%3D%3D&smid=AT95IG9ONZD7S&sprefix=jumper%2Caps%2C434&sr=8-2)


## Hardware Part:
1. There are two DS1307, one with a complete circuit another with only DS1307.

1. Both will work just fine for this Project.

1. Set the circuit as shown in the figure above.

_Circuit_

## Software Part:
1. After connecting the  STM32F446RE with the target now, connect to the computer where Keil uVision v5 is installed.

1. You can get the code from here 

1. After successfully flashing the code, the Build-in LED every second

1. That's it for now.

# Build Process of C: From Source Code to Executable

In the build process of C, there are many steps involved from writing a C program to converting it into an executable form.

Many software development tools like **Code::Blocks** or **Visual Studio Code**, in the name of "making things easy", hide many of these steps and make us believe weâ€™re some kind of muggles and that *magic* generates the executable code.

Letâ€™s strip away the illusion and explore what really happens!

_Overview_

---

## 1. Source Code

This is where it all begins.

* We create the definition for the `main()` function.
* Include standard libraries.
* Call a few functions.
* Make some blunder mistakesâ€¦ and fix them ðŸ˜‰

---

## 2. Preprocessing

In this step, the C source code is expanded based on preprocessor directives like `#define`, `#include`, etc.

* The expanded source code is stored in an intermediate file, usually with a `.i` extension.
* The exact extension may vary depending on the compiler used.

---

## 3. Compilation

The preprocessed code is then passed to the **compiler**, which:

* Checks for warnings and syntax errors.
* If error-free, translates the C code into **assembly language**.

ðŸ“„ Output: Assembly file (`.s` or `.asm`)

> Example: Assembly code for Intel Pentium will **not** run on a Snapdragon 888 processor.

---

## 4. Assembling

The **assembler** converts the `.asm` file into an **object file** (`.o` or `.obj`).

Object file contains:

* **Text Section**: Machine language instructions.
* **Data Section**: Global variables with initial values.
* **BSS Section**: Uninitialized global/static variables.
* **Symbol Table**: Metadata like names, types, addresses of variables and functions.

> Question: *If the object file contains machine code, why can't we run it directly?*

Answer: Because it doesnâ€™t yet know where external symbols like `printf()` are â€” those exist in other object files or libraries.

---

## 5. Linking

The **linker** comes in now to do the following:

* Combines all object files into a single file.
* Resolves references to external symbols (`printf`, etc.).
* Adjusts memory addresses of all variables and functions across files.

Example:

| Start Address | Variable Name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0             | `volt1`       |
| 2             | `count1`      |
| 6             | `temp1`       |

---

## 6. Executable File (.exe / ELF)

The final output is an executable file containing:

* All machine code in the **text section**.
* All initialized and uninitialized variables in **data** and **BSS** sections.

### Execution:

* Loaded into **RAM** by the Program Loader.
* Since addresses are relative, the program can run from any memory location.
* Execution starts from the first instruction in the **code section**.

---

## Final Note: Platform Differences

* Windows uses **Portable Executable (PE)** format.
* Linux uses **Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)**.

So, an executable compiled on **Windows wonâ€™t run on Linux** and vice versa â€” they are fundamentally different formats!

# Comparison of SPI, I2C, and UART Protocols

| **Feature**            | **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**                                                                 | **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**                                                                                 | **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**                                                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication Type** | Full Duplex (data can be transmitted and received simultaneously)                                     | Half Duplex (data is transmitted in one direction at a time)                                                       | Asynchronous (no clock signal, data transmitted one byte at a time)                                               |
| **Speed**              | Very fast, up to several Mbps (e.g., 10+ Mbps)                                                         | Moderate, typically up to 400 Kbps (but can go up to 3.4 Mbps in fast mode)                                        | Relatively slow, typically up to 1 Mbps                                                                            |
| **Number of Wires**    | 4 wires: MOSI, MISO, SCLK, SS (Chip Select)                                                           | 2 wires: SDA (Data) and SCL (Clock)                                                                                | 2 wires: TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive)                                                                            |
| **Data Addressing**    | No addressing; uses Chip Select (CS) to choose slave devices                                          | Addressing used; devices are identified by unique addresses                                                        | No addressing; direct communication between two devices                                                            |
| **Master-Slave**       | Supports multi-master and multi-slave configurations                                                  | Supports multi-master and multi-slave configurations, but more common with one master and multiple slaves          | One-to-one communication (one transmitter, one receiver)                                                           |
| **Error Checking**     | No built-in error checking; may rely on software                                                      | Includes ACK/NACK for error checking                                                                               | Parity bit can be used for error checking                                                                          |
| **Example Usage**      | - High-speed communication between microcontrollers and sensors  <br> - SD cards, TFT displays  <br> - *Example:* Connecting a temperature sensor to a microcontroller | - Low-speed communication between a master (e.g., microcontroller) and multiple peripherals <br> - EEPROM, RTC modules <br> - *Example:* Connecting a real-time clock (RTC) module to a microcontroller | - Serial communication between a computer and a microcontroller <br> - GPS modules, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi modules <br> - *Example:* UART-based communication between a GPS module and a microcontroller |

## Key Points in the Table

- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**: Full-duplex, fast communication for short distances, no addressing.
- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**: Half-duplex, moderate speed, supports addressing for multiple devices.
- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**: Asynchronous, often slower, used for communication between devices like computers and microcontrollers.

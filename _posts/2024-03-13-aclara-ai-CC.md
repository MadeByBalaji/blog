Utilidata announces Aclara as the inaugural partner to embed Karman, its distributed AI platform, in smart meters for a connected grid. Leveraging NVIDIA's Jetson platform, Karman provides utilities with enhanced processing power, enabling real-time grid insights and effective management of distributed energy resources (DERs). Aclara, a division of Hubbell Incorporated, brings decades of experience with over 30 million deployed electric meters in North America. This brings extensive experience as the first meter maker to integrate this advanced technology, marking a significant step towards grid modernization and real-time grid insights. 


This collaboration signifies a push towards grid modernization, aligning with federal funding initiatives and market demands. Marissa Hummon, Utilidata’s CTO, and Alexis Bernard, Hubbell’s CTO, will speak at NVIDIA GTC, while Utilidata’s president, Jess Melanson, will present at the Hubbell Utility Connect conference(previously Aclara Utility Connect). This partnership underscores the industry's shift towards software-defined solutions and the increasing role of AI in utility operations, paving the way for a resilient and reliable grid.

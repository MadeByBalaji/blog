Picture this: you're chilling with your fancy phone, but suddenly, a sneaky thief snatches it away. Bam! You grab another phone nearby and start calling your fancy one. But guess what? The thief is one step ahead; to avoid your calls, they turn off your mobile. But here's the twist: it asks for a PIN to turn off, not just to turn on.


Feature Request 1: 
	Add a PIN to turn off the mobile phone. While we have this feature today, crafty thieves might put the phone in flight mode instead of turning it off.


Kind Request 1: 
	Remove flight mode from the quick notification settings.


Feature Request 2: 
	Introduce location-based profiles. If I'm at work, my phone should switch to a work profile, and when I'm at home, it should switch to a personal profile.


See you around!

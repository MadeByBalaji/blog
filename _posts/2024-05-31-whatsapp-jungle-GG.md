**WhatsApp**, our beloved messaging app, can sometimes feel like a digital jungle. Between spam bots hawking dubious products, businesses bombarding us with "exclusive" offers and  OTPs popping up like uninvited guests, it's a wild ride. Remember the days when companies had to spend money to spam us via SMS? Now, thanks to WhatsApp being free, we get spammed like thereâ€™s no tomorrow. I blocked SMS notifications and now I need to block WhatsApp notifications too. I have unread SMS from 2020, the year I bought this phone! Now I always have some unread messages on WhatsApp, and I don't want an honorable mention on my relatives' group. 

Dear businesses, please have mercy and stop spamming us on our favorite app. Let's keep WhatsApp fun and spam-free!

## Two Fun Facts About ARM

### 1. Power Efficiency Pioneers

ARM processors are renowned for their **power efficiency**, which is a major reason they dominate **mobile and embedded systems**. The ARM architecture was **designed from the ground up** to minimize power consumption.

* Over **90% of smartphones** worldwide run on ARM.
* This efficiency is critical for **battery-powered devices** and fanless systems, where heat generation must be minimized.

### 2. Ubiquity in Everyday Devices

ARM processors aren't just for smartphones. They are used in:

* Smart thermostats
* Fitness trackers
* Automotive control systems
* Industrial IoT
* Even some **supercomputers**
  Thanks to its **scalable and modular architecture**, ARM fits across industries from consumer electronics to mission-critical systems.

Got it í ½í± youâ€™re already coding in C, so let me break down the **different data types and how to initialize them** with simple mental models and code snippets.

---

## 1. Normal Variables

Think of them as **boxes** holding values.

```c
int a = 10;        // integer
float f = 3.14;    // float
char c = 'A';      // single character
```

---

## 2. Arrays

An **array is a collection of boxes of the same type**, placed in sequence.

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};   // integer array
char str1[] = "Hello";          // string as char array (null-terminated)
char str2[6] = {'H','e','l','l','o','\0'}; // same thing explicitly
```

í ½í²¡ Rule: If you donâ€™t fully fill an array, remaining elements are `0`.

```c
int arr2[5] = {1,2};  // arr2 = {1,2,0,0,0}
```

---

## 3. Pointers

A **pointer is a box that stores the address of another box**.

```c
int x = 10;          
int *p = &x;        // pointer to int
printf("%d", *p);   // dereference â†’ prints 10
```

í ½í²¡ Trick:

* `&` = â€œaddress ofâ€
* `*` = â€œvalue at that addressâ€

---

## 4. Pointer + Array

Arrays and pointers are closely related.

```c
int arr[3] = {10,20,30};
int *p = arr;       // points to arr[0]

printf("%d", *(p+1)); // prints 20
```

---

##  5. Strings (char arrays vs pointers)

```c
char str1[] = "Hello";     // stored in modifiable array
char *str2 = "Hello";      // stored in read-only memory (canâ€™t change chars)
```

---

## 6. Structs

A **struct is a custom data type grouping multiple variables**.

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point p1 = {10, 20};   // initialize
```

With pointers:

```c
struct Point p2 = {30, 40};
struct Point *ptr = &p2;
printf("%d", ptr->x);   // prints 30
```

---

## **Mental model**:

* Normal variable â†’ box with value
* Array â†’ row of boxes
* Pointer â†’ box with an arrow to another box
* String â†’ char array ending with `'\0'`
* Struct â†’ box containing multiple labeled smaller boxes
